# Code With A Cause.

Code with a Cause was a collaborative event that set out to help provide local non-profits in the Saint Louis area, software solutions for
some of their problems.  This project was built for the ACLU of Missouri, who identified a need to be able to keep their complainants informed
about the status of their complaints. 
This is a fairly simple web app built on the ASP .NET framerwork and MVC architecture.  Because of time and other limitations we decided
that this would be the best way to deliver at least some value to their organization and hopefully relieve some of the burden on their 
employees by providing them a way to notify their clients in a timely manner whenever the status of their complaint changes.  This event
was a lot of fun and I learned a lot about project planning and working under the stress of extreme time constraints.
